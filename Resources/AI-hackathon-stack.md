# AI Hackathon Stack

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a **very** new/immature list, created for [the Latent Space Demo Day](https://lspace.swyx.io/p/demo-day-2023). The category labels not that well thought through. Please [get in touch](https://discord.gg/gR6yP6wbfq) if you have better ideas for how to organize this, it is welcome.

Below is a curated list of useful tools and examples for developers tackling AI Hackathons, together with useful hackathon-centric offers and templates for you to get started quickly.

If you represent a tool or vendor, please feel free to send in a PR for your tool, but note that we may reword or reject your submission based on subjective fit.



## AI Infra and Tooling

This category is for **infra and tools** catering to AI app developers, in contrast to **apps** (below) which have other kinds of end users in mind.

- **Tools to explore**
  - **Serverless GPUs**
    - https://exafunction.com/ Exafunction optimizes your deep learning inference workload, delivering up to a 10x improvement in resource utilization and cost.
    - https://www.banana.dev/ Scale your machine learning inference and training on serverless GPUs.
    - https://brev.dev/ The simplest way to create a dev environment with a GPU. Don't worry about dependencies, CUDA, SSH, or anything else. Up to 94% cheaper GPUs than AWS.
