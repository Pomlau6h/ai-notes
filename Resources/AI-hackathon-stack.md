# AI Hackathon Stack

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a **very** new/immature list, created for [the Latent Space Demo Day](https://lspace.swyx.io/p/demo-day-2023). The category labels not that well thought through. Please [get in touch](https://discord.gg/gR6yP6wbfq) if you have better ideas for how to organize this, it is welcome.

Below is a curated list of useful tools and examples for developers tackling AI Hackathons, together with useful hackathon-centric offers and templates for you to get started quickly.

If you represent a tool or vendor, please feel free to send in a PR for your tool, but note that we may reword or reject your submission based on subjective fit.



## AI Infra and Tooling

This category is for **infra and tools** catering to AI app developers, in contrast to **apps** (below) which have other kinds of end users in mind.

- **Tools to explore**
  - **Serverless GPUs**
    - https://exafunction.com/ Exafunction optimizes your deep learning inference workload, delivering up to a 10x improvement in resource utilization and cost.
    - https://www.banana.dev/ Scale your machine learning inference and training on serverless GPUs.
    - https://brev.dev/ The simplest way to create a dev environment with a GPU. Don't worry about dependencies, CUDA, SSH, or anything else. Up to 94% cheaper GPUs than AWS.
    - https://lambdalabs.com/ GPU cloud built for deep learning
Instant access to the best prices for cloud GPUs on the market. No commitments or negotiations required. Save over 73% vs AWS, Azure, and GCP. Configured for deep learning with PyTorch¬Æ, TensorFlow, Jupyter
    - _Seeking: hackathon-relevant examples and tutorials for each of these examples_
  - **Model Serving**
    - https://www.baseten.co/ serverless backend for building ML-powered applications. Build apps with auto-scaling, GPU access, CRON jobs, and serverless functions.
    - https://replicate.com/ Run models in the cloud at scale.
    - https://modal.com run or deploy machine learning models, massively parallel compute jobs, task queues, web apps, and much more, without your own infrastructure.. Example [serving Stable Diffusion API](https://modal.com/docs/guide/ex/stable_diffusion_slackbot)
    - _Seeking: hackathon-relevant examples and tutorials for each of these examples_
  - **Embeddings**
    - [**Chroma**](https://www.trychroma.com/): Chroma is the open-source embedding database. Chroma makes it easy to build LLM apps by making knowledge, facts, and skills pluggable for LLMs. [Docs](https://docs.trychroma.com/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/MMeYNTmh3x), [@ the founders](https://twitter.com/atroyn/status/1625568377766035456?s=20&t=m96ilnMSQjoyjVmp_kQHZA)
    - [**Pinecone**](https://www.pinecone.io/): The Pinecone vector database makes it easy to build high-performance vector search applications. [Docs](https://www.pinecone.io/docs/), [Events/Forum/Showcase](https://www.pinecone.io/community/).
