 [Minerva](https://twitter.com/matthewjbar/status/1542594514589581313?s=21&t=1t02xn9xyriXOte_d3RYyQ) will be considered the most important advance of the year. Minerva is a LLM trained to take math word problems and generate a step-by-step solution. In a particularly impressive result, Minerva got ~50% accuracy on the MATH dataset, much better than the previous 10% state-of-the-art result. This may not sound impressive until you realize how tough the MATH dataset is. This isn't a dataset of 'plug in the numbers' word problems from an introductory algebra class. This dataset is taken from high-school math competitions, designed to challenge the best mathematics students. Estimates of human performance are spotty, but the original MATH dataset paper gave the MATH dataset to a smart Computer Science undergrad student and got a performance around ~40%. Personally, I have a degree in statistics and I'd probably struggle to beat Minerva at these problems. It's conservative to say that Minerva is around 90th percentile of human performance in solving math problems.
