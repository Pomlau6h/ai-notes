## Data/Timeline

- Oct 2022: The Stack: 3 TB of permissively licensed source code in 30 programming languages https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack
- Nov 2022: Kite.com public failure https://www.kite.com/blog/product/kite-is-saying-farewell/
  - Our diagnosis is that individual developers do not pay for tools. Their manager might, but engineering managers only want to pay for discrete new capabilities, i.e. making their developers 18% faster when writing code did not resonate strongly enough.
