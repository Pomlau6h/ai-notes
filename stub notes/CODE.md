## Data/Timeline

- Oct 2021: Github Copilot technical preview - [team of 6 working on it](https://twitter.com/alexgraveley/status/1607897474965839872) 
- Dec 2021: Github Copilot [for businesses](https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/21/githubs_ai_code_assistant_copilot/)
- Feb 2022: February, DeepMind introduced [AlphaCode](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/competitive-coder/), a transformer pretrained on 86 million programs in 12 programming languages and fine-tuned on entries to coding contests. At inference, it generates a million possible solutions and filters out the bad ones. In this way, it retroactively beat more than half of contestants in 10 coding competitions.
- Jun 2022: Github Copilot GA
- Sep 2022: Github Copilot [productivity survey](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2022/09/13/copilot-impact.aspx)
- Sep 2022: BigCODE https://www.servicenow.com/blogs/2022/bigcode-large-language-models.html
- Oct 2022: The Stack: 3 TB of permissively licensed source code in 30 programming languages https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack
- Nov 2022: Kite.com public failure https://www.kite.com/blog/product/kite-is-saying-farewell/
  - Our diagnosis is that individual developers do not pay for tools. Their manager might, but engineering managers only want to pay for discrete new capabilities, i.e. making their developers 18% faster when writing code did not resonate strongly enough.
- Nov 2022: https://www.codeium.com/blog/beta-launch-announcement
- Dec 2022: reverse engineering copilot https://thakkarparth007.github.io/copilot-explorer/posts/copilot-internals.html#other-random-tidbits
- https://github.com/fauxpilot/fauxpilot This is an attempt to build a locally hosted version of [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/). It uses the [SalesForce CodeGen](https://github.com/salesforce/CodeGen) models inside of NVIDIA's [Triton Inference Server](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-triton-inference-server) with the [FasterTransformer backend](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/fastertransformer_backend/).
- Dec 2022: alphacode evaluation https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/main/ipynb/AlphaCode.ipynb
- Jan 2023: Copilot Labs https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-labs
- Feb 2023 https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-copilot-update-stops-ai-model-from-revealing-secrets/ Copilot will introduce a new paradigm called "Fill-In-the-Middle," which uses a library of known code suffixes and leaves a gap for the AI tool to fill, achieving better relevance and coherence with the rest of the project's code. Additionally, GitHub has updated the client of Copilot to reduce unwanted suggestions by 4.5% for improved overall code acceptance rates. "When we first launched GitHub Copilot for Individuals in June 2022, more than 27% of developers’ code files on average were generated by GitHub Copilot," Senior Director of Product Management Shuyin Zhao said.

"Today, GitHub Copilot is behind an average of 46% of a developers’ code across all programming languages—and in Java, that number jumps to 61%."

	- CodeComplete offers an experience similar to Copilot; we serve AI code completions as developers type in their IDEs. However, instead of sending private code snippets to GitHub or OpenAI, we use a self-hosted LLM to serve code completions. Another advantage with self-hosting is that it’s more straightforward to securely fine-tune to the company’s codebase. Copilot suggestions aren’t always tailored to a company’s coding patterns or internal libraries, so this can help make our completions more relevant and avoid adding tech debt.
