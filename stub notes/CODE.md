## Data/Timeline

- Oct 2022: The Stack: 3 TB of permissively licensed source code in 30 programming languages https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack
- Nov 2022: Kite.com public failure https://www.kite.com/blog/product/kite-is-saying-farewell/
  - Our diagnosis is that individual developers do not pay for tools. Their manager might, but engineering managers only want to pay for discrete new capabilities, i.e. making their developers 18% faster when writing code did not resonate strongly enough.
- Nov 2022: https://www.codeium.com/blog/beta-launch-announcement
- Dec 2022: reverse engineering copilot https://thakkarparth007.github.io/copilot-explorer/posts/copilot-internals.html#other-random-tidbits
- https://github.com/fauxpilot/fauxpilot This is an attempt to build a locally hosted version of [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/). It uses the [SalesForce CodeGen](https://github.com/salesforce/CodeGen) models inside of NVIDIA's [Triton Inference Server](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-triton-inference-server) with the [FasterTransformer backend](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/fastertransformer_backend/).
- Dec 2022: alphacode evaluation https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/main/ipynb/AlphaCode.ipynb
