	- We propose newly enabled attack vectors and techniques and provide demonstrations of each in this repository:
		-   Remote control of chat LLMs
		-   Leaking/exfiltrating user data
		-   Persistent compromise across sessions
		-   Spread injections to other LLMs
		-   Compromising LLMs with tiny multi-stage payloads
		-   Automated Social Engineering
		-   Targeting code completion engines
