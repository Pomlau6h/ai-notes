- DeepMind announced [Gato](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/one-model-hundreds-of-tasks/), a transformer that It learned over 600 diverse tasks — playing Atari games, stacking blocks using a robot arm, generating image captions, and so on — though not necessarily as well as separate models dedicated to those tasks. The system underwent supervised training on a wide variety of datasets simultaneously, from text and images to actions generated by reinforcement learning agents.
-   As the year drew to a close, researchers at Google brought a similar range of abilities to robotics. [RT-1](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/12/rt-1-robotics-transformer-for-real.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8HbXG-ZkwAj82Nv49uUrBwOHz4zUj3mkyjIfEd5lU7h3JHZR0pEG5OpkUCPPqwWvqMbjWl) is a transformer that enables robots to perform over 700 tasks. The system, which tokenizes actions as well as images, learned from a dataset of 130,000 episodes collected from a fleet of robots over nearly a year and a half. It achieved outstanding zero-shot performance in new tasks, environments, and objects compared to prior techniques.

- Flamingo models take advantage of two complementary  models: a vision model that analyzes visual scenes and a large language model   which performs a basic form of reasoning. The language model is trained on a  large amount of text data. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.04655.pdf
