	- ACT-1 is a large-scale Transformer trained to use digital tools — among other things, we recently taught it how to use a web browser. Right now, it’s hooked up to a Chrome extension which allows ACT-1 to observe what’s happening in the browser and take certain actions, like clicking, typing, and scrolling, etc. The observation is a custom “rendering” of the browser viewport that’s meant to generalize across websites, and the action space is the UI elements available on the page.
	- Features demoed:
		- human request -> execute it over long time horizon including observations on website
		- 10 clicks in salesforce -> 1 sentence
		- make execl formula in google sheets
		- coachable with human feedback
- MineDojo, a new open framework to help the community develop generally capable agents. 
	- MineDojo features a simulator suite based on Minecraft, a massive internet database (YouTube, Wiki, Reddit), and a simple but promising foundation model recipe for agents. https://twitter.com/DrJimFan/status/1595459499732926464
	  - We argue that there are 3 main ingredients for generalist agents to emerge. 
	  - First, an open-ended environment that allows an unlimited variety of tasks and goals. Earth is one example, as it is rich enough to forge an ever-expanding tree of life forms and behaviors. What else?
	  - Second, a large-scale knowledge base that teaches an AI not only *how* to do things, but also *what* are the useful things to do. GPT-3 learns from web text alone, but can we give our agent much richer data, such as video walkthroughs, multimedia tutorials, and free-form wiki?
	  - Third, an agent architecture flexible enough to pursue any task in open-ended environments, and scalable enough to convert large-scale, multimodal knowledge sources into actionable insights. Something like an *embodied* GPT-3.
