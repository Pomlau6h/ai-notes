## Papers and Good Reads

- [Recursively summarizing enables long-term dialogue memory in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15022): We prompt an arbitrary large language model to play two roles, i.e. memory management and response generator. The former is responsible for recursively summarizing the key information along with long-term dialogue, and the latter is to incorporate the memory to generate an appropriate response.
- [Evaluation & Hallucination Detection for Abstractive Summaries](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/abstractive/): good literature review blogpost on the major techniques for abstractive summarization
- Wired magazine coverage of OpenAI has an exclusive email interview with Alec Radford. [my comments.](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1699369076529971545)
- [Asking 60+ LLMs a set of 20 questions](https://benchmarks.llmonitor.com/) a set of informal benchmarks on a bunch of open source models. More interesting that people care about relatable benchmarks vs HellaSwag

## Fundraises and Milestones

- AI grant 2 https://twitter.com/danielgross/status/1699537311384699247
- Imbue fka Generally Intelligent $200M series B [tweet](https://twitter.com/kanjun/status/1699794157945208918?s=20),  [forbes profile](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/09/07/ai-research-lab-imbue-nabs-200-million-for-speculative-bet-to-build-ai-agents/?sh=7903e5d2b1ee)

## AI Eng Tooling

- [LangChain Hub](https://twitter.com/LangChainAI/status/1699095883512778823) ([blog](https://blog.langchain.dev/langchain-prompt-hub/)) - prompt publishing, discovery, sharing
- [DSPy](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37417698) - we covered this last month, but seems to have done its HN launch this month. lots of discussion and confusion over what exactly it does for automatic prompt engineering. DSPy is built on DSP - A paper is [forthcoming](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37423746).

## Agents

## Open Source Projects and templates

- [Open Interpreter](https://twitter.com/hellokillian/status/1699156860073640038) an open-source Code Interpreter that runs locally.
- [WhatsApp-Llama: A clone of yourself from your WhatsApp conversations](https://github.com/Ads-cmu/WhatsApp-Llama) - good example code of a simple finetune you can do altho results not great yet. However TIL Meta has a llama-recipes repo.


## Useful learning

- [The math behind Attention Mechanisms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtG_38Oq8o) - math behind the Keys, Queries, and Values matrices, in a friendly pictorial way using diagrams and linear transformations
- [Can LLMs learn from a single example?](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2023-09-04-learning-jumps/)
