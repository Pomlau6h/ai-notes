## GPT specific notes

My best timeline of GPT efforts is listed here: https://lspace.swyx.io/p/open-source-ai

GPT3 applications:
  - text to graphviz https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1561549768987496449?s=21&t=rliacnWOIjJMiS37s8qCCw
  - suspending to python for math   
    - https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1414029295043764226?lang=en
    - https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1568824744367259648
    - and API's https://twitter.com/sergeykarayev/status/1569377881440276481
  - Amelia paragraph sumarizer https://twitter.com/Wattenberger/status/1412480516268437512
  - Karina Nguyen Synevyr https://twitter.com/karinanguyen_/status/1566884536054677506
  - Lex.page
  - https://humanloop.com/ Playground that brings variable interpolation to prompts and lets you turn them into API endpoints. Once you're deployed, it also lets you collect past generations along with user behavioral feedback for fine-tunes.
  - https://www.everyprompt.com/ extends Playground in a similar way: Putting variables in prompts and giving you a single button to go from prompt to API. Has nice developer-oriented touches in the UI too â€” e.g. displaying invisible chars as ghosts.
  - LangChain https://twitter.com/hwchase17/status/1588183981312180225
    - implements and lets you easily compose many published LLM prompting techniques. Implements self-asking, web search, REPL math, and several of my own prompts.
    - All relevant chains now have a "verbose" option to highlight text according to the model or component (SQL DB, search engine, python REPL, etc) that it's from. 
  - https://dust.tt/ gives a collapsible tree UI for representing k-shot example datasets, prompt templates, and prompt chaining with intermediate JS code. Replaces a lot of code around prompt APIs.
